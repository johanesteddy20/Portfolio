            <h3>Wechat Ordering System Project</h3>
            <p>In the project am learning some tools for designing back-end applications, such as Node.js (JavaScript), MySQL, WXSS (Weixin CSS), and HTML, which are related to their project. Provided support in terms of helping them designing their project and also learn some of techniques such as back end and front end. Effectively using files such as index.js and index.wxss to create a good design. Initiated the program by debugging it to ensure no errors appeared while running the mini program. Then ran the program by activating the backend server using Visual Studio Code and ran the program in the frontend, connecting to databases.

            <h3>Tetris Game Project</h3>
            <p>In this project, I teamed up with two of my friends to create a Tetris game using Python. We decided to first develop the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for our game project before working on the Tetris shapes using Python's API. We discussed the project among ourselves, and after completing it, we thoroughly tested the game to ensure no errors appeared. Additionally, we attempted to enhance the gaming experience by incorporating music into our project, making it more enjoyable for players. </p>
